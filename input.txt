Forget about the days when it's been cloudy. But don't forget your hours in the sun.
Forget about the times you have been defeated. But don't forget the victories you have won.
Forget about the misfortunes you have encountered. But don't forget the times your luck has turned.
Forget about the days when you have been lonely. But don't forget the friendly smiles you have seen.
Forget about the plans that didn't seem to work out right. But don't forget to always have a dream.
